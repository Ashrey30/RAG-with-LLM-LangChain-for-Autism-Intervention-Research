# LangChain Integration for Multimodal AI Approach to Streamline Autism Diagnosis

## Overview:
This repository showcases the integration of LangChain, a natural language processing toolkit, to streamline the process of autism diagnosis in young children. By leveraging LangChain's functionalities, including document loading, text processing, embedding generation, and document retrieval, we aim to provide a comprehensive solution for querying relevant research documents related to multimodal AI approaches for autism diagnosis.
